# Python-Learning

Why choose Python?
    - Designed for clear, logical code that is easy to read and learn
    - Lots of existing libraries and frameworks written in python allowing users to apply Python to a wide variety of tasks.
    - Focuses on optimizing developer time, rather than a computer's proccessing time.
    - Great documentation online:
